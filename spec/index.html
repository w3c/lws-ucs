      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      The LWS specifications aim to enable the development of web applications where data storage, entity authentication, access control, and application provider are all loosely coupled, as compared to the web of today where these are typically all tightly coupled, so changing one requires changing all, sometimes at a cost of all past data.
      </p>
      <p>
      This document lists user stories and use-cases for the LWS specifications, as well as requirements identified as necessary to satisfy these use cases.
