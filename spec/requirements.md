 1. <dfn>Globally Unique Identifiers</dfn> — Resources, including Entities and Storages, shall be uniquely identifiable globally. No two distinct Resources shall share the same Identifier (though a "collective" Resource with one Identifier may be comprised of several Resources, each with its own Identifier, and actions taken on the collective Resource can affect all the Resources which comprise the collective Resource). A Resource may be identifiable via multiple, distinct identifiers. A Resource Owner shall be able to prove control of owned Resource Identifiers.
 2. <dfn>Use of Service Providers</dfn> — The protocol shall provide a mechanism for Entities to delegate some functions to trusted Service Providers. Some interactions may require a trust relationship between Service Providers and Entities. In general, this should not impede the ability of an Entity to operate or self-host a service. Also, trust relationship are not transitive, in the sense that if an Entity trusts a Service Provider, e.g. an Identity Provider, it does not follow that another Service Provider the Entity interacts with, e.g. a Storage Provider, is under any obligation to trust said Identity Provider.
 3. <dfn>Control of Storages</dfn> — An Entity shall be able to control one or more Storages across one or more Storage Providers. A Storage shall have exactly one Controller.
 4. <dfn>Delegation of Control</dfn> — The system shall allow for an Entity to delegate control of a Storage to another Entity. Delegation could be temporary, i.e. have an expiration time, or not. An Entity shall be able to modify delegation at a later time, either by changing expiration of revoking it altogether.
 5. <dfn>Transfer of Control</dfn> — The system shall allow for an Entity to transfer, i.e. reassign, ownership of a Storage to another Entity. Transfer is final and irrevocable.
 6. <dfn>Storage Portability</dfn> — The system shall allow for an Entity to port, i.e. move or transfer, the entire contents of a Storage from one Storage Provider to another. Once the move is complete, the previous Storage shall be freed from any responsibility related to the Storage.
 7. <dfn>Adding, Updating, Deleting Resources in Storage</dfn> — The system shall allow for Resources to be added, updated and/or deleted within a Storage by authorized Entities. In general the system shall allow for any type of resource to be stored in a Storage, however Storage Providers may impose certain limitations, such as of type or size.
 8. <dfn>Data Sharing</dfn> — The system shall support an Entity to allow access of another Entity to a Resource it controls. In other words, a Storage Provider shall be able an Entity to access a Resource it does not control based on a verifiable proof of consent supplied by the Owner Entity.
 9. <dfn>Auditable trail</dfn> — The system shall provide an auditable log of all access requests and grants to Resources and all read/write/delete of Resources.
