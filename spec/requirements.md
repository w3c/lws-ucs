1.  <dfn>Globally Unique Identifiers</dfn> — Resources, including Entities and Storages, shall be uniquely identifiable globally. No two distinct Resources shall share the same Identifier (though a "collective" Resource with one Identifier may be comprised of several Resources, each with its own Identifier, and actions taken on the collective Resource can affect all the Resources which comprise the collective Resource). A Resource may be identifiable via multiple, distinct identifiers.

    Stories: Globally Unique Identifiers

2.  <dfn>Use of Service Providers</dfn> — The protocol shall provide a mechanism for Entities to delegate some functions to trusted Service Providers. Some interactions may require a trust relationship between Service Providers and Entities. In general, this should not impede the ability of an Entity to operate or self-host a service. Also, trust relationships are not transitive, in the sense that if an Entity trusts a Service Provider, e.g. an Identity Provider, it does not follow that another Service Provider the Entity interacts with, e.g. a Storage Provider, is under any obligation to trust said Identity Provider.

    Stories: Storage Ownership

4.  <dfn>Delegation of Control</dfn> — The system shall allow for an Entity to delegate control of a Storage to another Entity. Delegation could be temporary, i.e. have an expiration time, or not. An Entity shall be able to modify delegation at a later time, either by changing expiration or revoking it altogether.  
    Stories: Delegation of Control

5.  <dfn>Transfer of Control</dfn> — The protocol shall allow for an Entity to transfer, i.e. irrevocably reassign control of a Storage to another Entity.  
    Stories: Delegation of Control

6.  <dfn>Storage Portability</dfn> — The protocol shall allow for an Entity to port, i.e. move or transfer, the entire contents of a Storage from one Storage Provider to another. Once the move is complete, the previous Storage Provider shall be freed from any responsibility related to the Storage.

    Stories: Portable Storage

7.  <dfn>Adding, Updating, Deleting Resources in Storage</dfn> — The protocol shall allow for Resources to be added, updated and/or deleted within a Storage by authorized Entities. In general the protocol shall allow for any type of resource to be stored in a Storage, however Storage Providers may impose certain limitations, such as of type or size.

8.  <dfn>Data Sharing</dfn> — The protocol shall allow an Entity to grant access to a Resource it controls to another Entity. In other words, the first Entity may allow the other Entity to perform some operations (read, modify, remove...) on the Resource. Access grant could be temporary, i.e. have an expiration time, or not. The first Entity shall be able to modify delegation at a later time, either by changing the expiration time or revoking it altogether.

10. <dfn>Serialization Format</dfn> — The protocol shall make it possible for data in a Storage to be serialized in a known format.  
    Stories: Data Integration, Personal Information Management

11. <dfn>Offline Access and Synchronization</dfn> — The protocol shall allow Entities to access and modify data even when disconnected from the network, with local changes synchronized to the online Storage once connectivity is restored. This includes providing strong guarantees against data corruption and robust conflict resolution to ensure data consistency after offline edits.  
    Stories: Offline Data Access, Storage Listening

12. <dfn>Resumable Large Data Transfers</dfn> — The protocol shall support efficient handling of large files and data streams, including the ability to resume interrupted uploads/downloads. This ensures that network or server interruptions do not force restarting an entire transfer, improving reliability for big file operations.

    Issues: [#18](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues/18)  
    Stories: Large File Uploads

13. <dfn>Data Versioning</dfn> — The protocol shall support maintaining and retrieving previous versions of Resources. Authorized Entities should be able to recover or inspect earlier versions of data (including metadata and access control states) to enable undoing changes, auditing modifications, or recovering from accidental deletions. This helps ensure data durability and traceability over time.  
    Stories: Generic Storage

14. <dfn>Notification and Eventing</dfn> — The protocol shall provide a mechanism to notify relevant Entities of significant events, such as changes to Resources or updates to access permissions. For example, if access rights on a Resource change or new data is available, the affected parties can be alerted in a timely manner. Notification delivery may be real-time (e.g., push/SSE) or via queued channels (e.g., email or inbox), respecting user preferences and privacy.

    Stories: Notifications for Permission Changes, Real-Time Notifications, Application Notifications

15. <dfn>Access Request Handling</dfn> — The protocol shall enable an Entity to request access to a Resource they are currently not authorized to use, and allow the Resource owner (or controller) to review and grant or deny such requests. There should be a standard way for a requester to signal a desire for access and for the owner to be notified and respond. This ensures that data owners can easily share data upon request without preemptively granting broad access.

    Stories: Health Record Access

16. <dfn>Delegation of Access Rights</dfn> — Beyond whole-storage control delegation, the protocol shall allow an Entity who has certain access rights on a Resource to delegate a subset of those rights to another Entity, if permitted by the original owner. Such sub-delegation may be temporary or scoped, and the original grantor (or the Resource owner) shall be able to revoke or modify the delegated rights at any time.

    Stories: Administrative Assistant, Health Record Access

17. <dfn>Contextual Access Control</dfn> — The access control mechanisms shall support context-aware policies. An Entity should be able to impose additional conditions on Resource access based on context such as time windows, location, or group membership status. For instance, a policy could allow access only during certain hours, or only if the requesting party is within a specific role or group at the time.

18. <dfn>Inter-User Communication</dfn> — The protocol shall provide a mechanism for users (or their agents/applications) to exchange messages or data directly via their Storages in a standardized way, enabling built-in collaboration without relying on external messaging services. For example, a user should be able to send a message, notification, or invite to another user's Storage (with appropriate authorization), and the receiving user's client can retrieve or be alerted to this message.

20. <dfn>Self-Descriptive and Discoverable APIs</dfn> — The protocol shall include means for Services to discover available capabilities and navigate a Storage's data and access control interfaces uniformly. This way, Services can store, read, update, and delete their data within user-managed Storages, so that Users retain data ownership and sovereignty over app-generated content. This could be achieved via hypermedia controls or standard descriptors in responses (e.g., JSON-LD links indicating available actions or endpoints). Servers should provide a discoverable description of their supported protocol versions, extensions, or features.

21. <dfn>End-to-End Encryption</dfn> — The protocol shall enable end-to-end encryption of data such that data stored or transmitted is unreadable to anyone except the authorized parties. Even Storage Providers or network intermediaries cannot decrypt the content (only the data owner and intended recipients can). End-to-end encryption should be achievable for data at rest and in transit, using standard algorithms.

22. <dfn>Data Integrity Verification</dfn> — The protocol shall incorporate mechanisms to ensure and verify the integrity of stored data. Authorized Entities should be able to detect if data has been tampered with or corrupted (whether at rest or in transit). For example, the system may use cryptographic hashes, signatures, or checksums so clients can confirm that a Resource retrieved from Storage is exactly as originally stored by the owner.
