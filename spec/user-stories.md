### Administrative Assistant

As a Manager I want my administrative Assistant to exercise some, but not all, of my permissions, such as updating my calendar and screening my email, so that I don't have to waste my time on these matters. Manager spends a lot of time scheduling appointments and dealing with unimportant emails. Common permission infrastructure, such a Role-Based, Attribute-Based, or Policy-Based access control, doesn't provide sufficient flexibility for Manager to offload some of this work to Assistant and Assistant to offload some of that work to others.


### Large HTTP uploads

As a `user`,
I want to upload large files that may or may/not complete due to network and/or server issues.  Further, for very large uploads also knowing what percentage of a file(s) that is uploaded is handy to have as both user and developer.
