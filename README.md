## Defining User Stories

LWS user stories are classified under the following categories:

* Functional: specific features or capabilities (e.g., "As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account.").
* Non-Functional: related to qualities of service, such as performance, security, or scalability (e.g., "As an administrator, I want the storage server to handle up to 10,000 concurrent connections at peak.").
* Technical: related to infrastructure tasks (e.g., "As a Service Provider, I want the ability to archive LWS storages").
* Spike: used to explore or research an unknown aspect of the project (e.g., "Research what Identity System supports delegation.").
